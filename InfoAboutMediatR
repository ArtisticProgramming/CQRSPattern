-------------------------------------Deff between Request and Notification------------------------------
Requests are for:
1 request to 1 handler. Handler may or may not return a value

Notifications are for:
1 notification to n handlers. Handler may not return a value.

In practical terms, requests are "commands", notifications are "events".
Command would be directing MediatR to do something like
"ApproveInvoiceCommand -> ApproveInvoiceHandler". Event would be
notifications, like "InvoiceApprovedEvent ->
SendThankYouEmailToCustomerHandler"
